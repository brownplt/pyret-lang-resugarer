@title{Pyret Language Reference}

This document has detailed information on the Pyret grammar and the behavior of
its expression forms.  The entire grammar is included at the end of the
document for reference, with its pieces introduced individually first.  This
document cannot be read beginning-to-end assuming no experience with Pyret.
Rather, it explains in detail the semantics and grammar of each syntactic form,
and is heavily cross-referential when describing features that interact.  This
document also occasionally references ``Captain Teach'', which is a programming
and learning environment that uses Pyret, and has some of its own environmental
behavior that is worth noting.

@section[#:tag "s:mutables"]{Mutables}

A @tt{Mutable} value is created implicitly by use of the @tt{mutable} keyword
on a field, or explicitly with the @tt{mk-mutable} function.  Most Pyret
programs do not need to create @tt{Mutable}s explicitly.

@(label "mk-mutable")

@justcode{
<a> mk-mutable(
      val :: a,
      read :: (a -> Bool),
      write :: (a -> Bool)
    )
    -> Mutable<a>
}

This creates a mutable value holding @tt{val} as a value, and with predicates
@tt{read} and @tt{write} checked on access and update, respectively.  These
predicates are automatically filled in based on annotations for @tt{Mutable}s
created by @tt{data}.  If the predicate fails in either case, a type error is
signalled.

Aside from constructing a @tt{Mutable} directly, they can be accessed directly
by using a @seclink["s:colon-expr" "colon expression"], which gives access to
several methods:

@(label "Mutable.get")

@justcode{
get(self :: Mutable<a>) -> a
}

Returns the value in the @tt{Mutable}.  

@(label "Mutable._equals")

@justcode{
get(self :: Mutable<a>, other :: Any) -> Bool
}

Returns @tt{true} if @tt{other} is the @emph{same} mutable as this one,
@tt{false} otherwise.

@(label "Mutable.tostring")

@justcode{
tostring(self :: Mutable<a>) -> String
}

Returns a string representation of the mutable.  To avoid cyclic printing, this
just gives the string @tt{"mutable-field"}.

@section[#:tag "s:placeholders"]{Placeholders}

Placeholder values are created automatically by @tt{graph} declarations, and
can be explicitly created with @tt{mk-placeholder}, though most Pyret programs
will not need to.  This section is mainly for those wishing a deeper
understanding of how @tt{graph} and @tt{cyclic} interact.

A @tt{Placeholder} is a value that supports a single @emph{update}, and
multiple @emph{guards} before being updated.  The design goal of
@tt{Placeholder}s is to support many contexts sharing the same (possibly
un-initialized) value, with each context placing its own constraints on the
value prior to it being initialized.  The following methods are on each
@tt{Placeholder} value:

@(label "Placeholder.get")

@justcode{
get(self :: Placeholder<a>) -> a
}

Get the value in the placeholder.  Signals an exception if the value has
@emph{yet to be} initialized with the @tt{set} method.

@(label "Placeholder.guard")

@justcode{
guard(self :: Placeholder<a>, guard :: (a -> Bool)) -> Nothing
}

Update the placeholder with an additional check @tt{guard}.  Signals an
exception if the value has @emph{already been} initialized with the @tt{set}
method.

@(label "Placeholder.set")

@justcode{
set(self :: Placeholder<a>, value :: a) -> a
}

Initialize the placeholder with @tt{value}.  Signals an exception if any of the
guards on the placeholder return non-@tt{true} values when applied to
@tt{value}, or if the placeholder has already been @tt{set}. 

These three methods are used in concert by @tt{graph} and @tt{cyclic} to safely
and lazily intialize mutually-referential data.  Each left-hand side in a
@tt{graph} binding gets a new placeholder value with no guards.  Each
constructor with a @tt{cyclic} modifier on a field that is called adds a guard
to the placeholder based on the annotation on that field.  Then, at the end of
the @tt{graph} declaration, the placeholders are all @tt{set} to the values on
the right-hand side of the graph bindings.  If any placeholder was used in an
incorrect context, a type error is signalled at this point.  After graph
initialization, subsequent accesses of the placeholder fields with
@seclink["s:dot-expr" "dot expressions"] use the @tt{get} operation to access
the initialized value.

A few other methods are on @tt{Placeholder} values, as well:

@(label "Placeholder._equals")

@justcode{
get(self :: Placeholder<a>, other :: Any) -> Bool
}

Returns @tt{true} if @tt{other} is the @emph{same} @tt{Placeholer} as this one,
@tt{false} otherwise.

@(label "Placeholder.tostring")

@justcode{
tostring(self :: Placeholder<a>) -> String
}

Returns a string representation of the placeholder.  To avoid cyclic printing, this
just gives the string @tt{"placeholder-field"}.
